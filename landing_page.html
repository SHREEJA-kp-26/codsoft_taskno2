                                    Creative agencies provide innovative solutions to their clients’ needs by crafting inspired campaigns that are both uniquely theirs and collaborative.  If you’re interested in what creative agencies do but have a hard time separating their responsibilities from other similar company types (like ad agencies, production companies, etc.), we got you covered.  

Upon embarking on a career in the industry, it’s good to know the differences and understand what makes these businesses different yet so complementary to each other. 

Let’s get into it.
